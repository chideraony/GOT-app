    //  * whether the app is fetching data (loading)

    //  Each part of the state will need to be passed down to its respective component(s) in order for it
    //  to be displayed/updated in the correct part of the UI
    //  * E.g. maybe you can expand/collapse the sidebar from the header and the feed, as well as the sidebar itself
    //  This means that the state will need to be accessed/updated from all of these components!

    // To get started:
    // TODO - add in an expanded state/setState
    // TODO - add in a feedResults state/setState
    // (See cheat sheet for useState example)


    // TODO - import getData() from api (you will need to write this function)
    //         and call it here (setting the results to the feedResults)
    // TODO [STRETCH] - implement loading state and pass to FeedComponent

    // TODO - pass in expanded sidebar state to components that need to know about it/update it.
